cryptotun:
  highspeed elliptic-curve encrypted tun program
  for peer2peer networking. cryptotun has a dead
  simple interface for implementing a functional
  tun device in moments. cryptotun uses state of
  the art NaCl cryptography and provides perfect
  forward secrecy, mobility, reliability between
  two or more systems.

thanks:
  djb -> daemontools and nacl are unmatched
  ivo smits -> insights on nacl and tun/tap devices
  talamon -> testing and commiting scripts for tap support

depends:
  daemontools, nacl, gcc, sh

todo:
  initial commit (expect changes), search optimizations

install:
  ./install-nacl.sh
  ./install-libtai.sh
  ./Make.sh

usage:
  ./scripts/add-cryptotun --rtfm

  # notes on tap:
  # talamon> brd addr 255.255.255.252 in a 1.30.30.30/30 
  #          subnet also send to 1.30.30.32/32
  #
  # talamon> brd for a /30 is 255.255.255.252
  #
  # talamon> broadcast in 1.1.7.0/30 is 1 and 4
  #
  # talamon> tap addr with be 1.122.22.2/30 for example
